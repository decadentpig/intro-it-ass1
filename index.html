      <h2>Personal Info</h2>
    </a>
    <div id='para-info' class='body-content'>
      <p>My name is Jordan De Visser, I’m a student and public servant living in Brisbane. I am Australian with Swedish
        heritage, and I speak English (plus a vanishing amount of Hindi). In my spare time I write short fiction.
        Recently, I finished editing the first issue of a Brisbane-based literary magazine called Urinal Mag, which is
        available in print soon. It collects short stories and poetry from around my city.</p>

      <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    </a>
    <div id='para-interest' class='body-content'>
      <p>I have been interested in technology my entire life. My first vivid memory of a computer involves playing
        Lemmings on a tobacco-beige Windows 95 machine. Since then I have always kept up to date with developments in
        hardware and software.<br><br>

        Most of my IT experience is informal. I work in administration, and so part of my job inevitably involves some
        technical support (for printers, fax machines, enterprise software etc.). This support work is usually
        improvised and definitely additional to my job description. During COVID I began learning HTML, CSS and
        JavaScript, and find the web development space vibrant and interesting.<br><br>

        I chose RMIT for a variety of reasons. I have known people who have been RMIT students in the past, and I’ve
        also been impressed by RMIT's rankings in the country and worldwide. During my studies I expect to gain both a
        macro and a micro view of computers and the tech industry. I expect to learn a lot about the variety of
        specialisations within the industry, and to gain specific knowledge and skills for getting involved.</>

      <h3>Junior Software Engineer, Octopus Deploy</h3>

        <a href='snapshot2.png'>(Snapshot 2)</a>
      <h4>Description:</h4>
      <p>The job advertisement I’ve chosen is for a junior engineer at a company called Octopus Deploy. The company is
        involved in making software deployment automation tools. The ad appealed to me because it is targeted at junior
        developers with a passion for learning, and the job description suggests that the role is perfect for someone
        looking for strong mentorship and an opportunity to be hands-on.</p>
      <h4>Skills I have:</h4>
      <p>At the moment, I am able to demonstrate myself as a self-starter, with a few simple web projects under my belt
        and a 300-hour JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures certificate from an online bootcamp. Crucially, I’m
        working towards a Bachelor in Information Technology, which will equip me with a variety of relevant skills. At
        the moment I am also learning Java, a statically-typed language, which I hope will help me to step across into
        learning TypeScript.</p>
      <h4>Skills needed:</h4>
      <p>A year or more of on-the-job development experience, as well as some familiarity with TypeScript, React and C#.
        Experience with building, testing and deploying a product will be important, especially when the company’s own
        product concerns automating some of these processes.</p>
      <h4>Plan:</h4>
      <p>My plan is to finish a Bachelor in Information Technology, while also continuing my self-directed
        web-development learning. In particular, I’d like to learn and become comfortable with the React library, which
        is currently popular and relevant not only to this job but to many others. Over the course of this learning I’d
        like to build, test and deploy some hobby projects of my own that are interesting to me and that might attract
        users, so that I can gain real working experience of making software products.</p>

      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>I believe these test results reveal me to be someone who is passionate, obsessive and driven, creative and
        conflict-averse. In a team setting, my strengths lie in my identity as a mediator and as a quiet creative
        workhorse. I’m always interested in healing disputes between others and maintaining smooth sailing. A firm big
        picture perspective on a project is important for me, as I find it hard to work within vague bounds or without a
        clear roadmap. This is a trait that may not gel well in teams with a laissez-faire attitude or improvised
        working style.</p>

      <h2>Project Idea</h2>
    </a>
    <div id='para-project' class='body-content'>
      <h4>Overview</h4>

      <p>My project idea is for a browser-based, asynchronous multiplayer factory management game, themed around a
        vaccine “arms race” - a <i>Jabs-In-Arms</i> race. Designed to be checked-in with two or three times a day, the
        game sees players tasked with
        creating an efficient production and distribution flow toward a final goal, while attempting to sabotage fellow
        players by various means such as bottlenecking supply, cutting power and dumping waste. In short, think
        <i>Settlers
          of Catan</i> meets <i>Factorio</i>, with the social aspect and general pace of fantasy football or <i>Words
          with Friends</i>. And
        all of it available on mobile or in your web browser in a sleek, minimalist representation.</p>


      <h4>Motivation</h4>

      <p>A game of this sort is interesting to me for a few reasons. Not least of all thematically, as vaccine
        development and rollout in the COVID era is likely to be a topic at the forefront of current affairs for some
        time to come. And as these events drag on, people will no doubt continue to search for new ways to interact
        remotely with their friends. Providing a platform for socially-distant interaction that also explores some
        subject matter is something I’m interested in applying myself to.</p>

      <p>Additionally, mobile games are more popular than ever, with time spent playing them increasing 8-10% every year
        (Business Wire 2020, para. 3). Mobile games with deceptively simple gameplay loops and rewards for repetitive
        behaviour perform really well. This is largely because the strategies used in designing them are borrowed from
        the behavioural sciences, such as from the conditioning research conducted by BF Skinner and applied
        deliberately to game design principles as early as 2001 (Joseph Kim 2014).</p>


      <h4>Description</h4>

      <p><b>Premise:</b> The game takes place in a fictional sci-fi setting, in which an alien virus has overtaken a
        fleet of
        asteroid miners. It’s fortunate, at least, that the components required to make a vaccine are found inside the
        asteroids themselves. However to complicate things further, the miners are part of a diplomatic network of
        factions — each of whom are desperate to develop the vaccine first and return to their homeworld, abandoning the
        rest. Players aim to manufacture, distribute, vaccinate and exfiltrate their miners first, sabotaging other
        players along the way.</p>

      <p><b>Platform:</b> Players can access the game from any browser and continue their game in progress. Because of
        its
        minimalistic visual representation, the game is able to be written in JavaScript from front to back and should
        play nicely in most modern browsers. A purpose-built mobile application would be worth investigating, especially
        as people are more likely to return to a game if it is an app on their home screen (and does not require typing
        a URL).</p>

      <p><b>Gameplay:</b> A single match takes place over the course of a week or so in real time. Most operations
        happen
        passively, with the player logging in periodically to flick switches.</p>

      <p>At the very beginning of the chain, an asteroid can be mined for one of three resource types, with the ability
        to switch to mining at given intervals. Resources and personnel are then moved systematically from an asteroid
        to a base ship, from the base ship over conveyor belts to sorting hubs, on belts from the hubs to a factory that
        transforms them into refined components, and from the factory to a lab where components are mixed into a
        vaccine. Personnel are sent along these same routes to wait in a limited queue in the lab, where they are
        injected and then finally moved to a sterile ship, from which they can be exfiltrated only once all persons have
        made it through the course.</p>

      <p>A few parts along this chain are expandable, with an associated resource cost. Deciding what to upgrade and how
        to organise the chain forms the core of the gameplay loop, as well as micromanagement of what resource is mined
        at any one time and when personnel are instructed to enter a place in the chain that would otherwise hold a
        resource.</p>

      <p>The asynchronous multiplayer aspect comes in the form of an event queue. At certain points in a player’s game,
        they are given the opportunity to send a sabotage to another player. This sabotage (such as a broken belt,
        tripped fuse, impure resource) is sent to the other player where it sits in a queue to be dealt out at an
        invisibly-determined pace. In this way, players can send each other many sabotages that come down through the
        pipeline in a structured way. Aside from this feature, and from the meta challenge to complete the game before
        anybody else does, the game is essentially single-player.</p>


      <h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>

      <p>In order to host both the game and its source code, a remote version control service like GitHub will be
        necessary. As far as communication tools, a development team would use platforms such as Microsoft Team and
        Zooms to collaborate efficiently. For the website, HTML, CSS and JavaScript will be used to make a sleek,
        mobile-first interface.</p>

      <p>Concerning the game itself, the front-end will be programmed in vanilla JavaScript (making it easily adaptable
        to the web) and a back-end technology such as Node.js would be used to handle user data, saves states and
        interactions. An IDE like VSCode or Notepad++ will be important for developing the game. Programs like Aseprite,
        Photoshop or GIMP may come in handy for the creation of simple, minimalistic art assets.</p>


      </h4>Skills Required:</h4>

      <p>There are a few skills necessary for a team to have in order to build and launch a game like this. First you
        would need a designer to mock up both the website and the game’s UI elements. A front-end web developer would
        then be necessary for creating the site to the designer’s specifications. Meanwhile, one or more programmers
        with some front and back experience would work to bring the game to a functional state with a barebones visual
        component that can be matched to the designer’s plans at a later date. Finally, someone experienced with servers
        would go to work hosting the site and the database at the back end of the game.</p>

      <p>While many of these skills are out of reach for beginners, I believe it’s possible for a team of any experience
        to create a single-player prototype of the game that can be hosted on the internet. A prototype version of this
        game without a backend would not be able to persist in real-time, but could be stepped-through for demonstration
        of the concept.</p>


      <h4>Outcome:</h4>

      <p>If this game is successful, the outcome will be that a small core of dedicated players would interact with the
        site daily, while a yet more casual group logged in semi-regularly. A playerbase of this kind provides a few
        different opportunities for revenue, with some options better suited than others to this specific audience. The
        impact of this development would be that there would be an excellent factory management game that busy friends
        can play asynchronously from computers all around the world. It would have a low-barrier to entry and a very
        rewarding gameplay loop — a successful product overall.</p>
